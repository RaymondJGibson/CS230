Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The gaming room was a small gaming company that created a word game app. They needed help running the app across multiple users/environments. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think the analysis of what the gaming room needed was done fairly well. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

While I don't think the design doc helped much with the actual implementation it did help to ground my understanding of the client. As we went through the implementation I understood at a fundamental level why we were doing what we were doing and how the client would end up using it. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think the compare and contrast between linux and Windows was pretty good but a deeper dive into the actual differences would be really interesting. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It's important to consider the users needs when designing because if you don't you may go off on a tangent and do something completely different that they don't want.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

To design a similar piece of software in the future I would probably not use a UML diagram per say but would use some kind of flow chart showing the different actions a user could take and how those actions would flow through the software components.
